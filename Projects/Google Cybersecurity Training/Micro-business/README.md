## Scenario

You’re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.

Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

To do this, you’ll need to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, you will review the access log of the incident. Next, you will take notes that can help you identify a possible threat actor. Then, you will spot issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, you will recommend mitigations that can improve the business' access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.

### The objective

- 1-2 notes about the user

- 1-2 access control issues

## My approach

I began the investigation by reviewing the event log, the details of the log shows when and whose computer did the fund transfer. The transaction was done on 10/03/2023 at 8:29:57am by Legal/Administrator user who use Up2-NoGud computer and the IP address is 152.207.255.255, after I got the basic info intruder I compared info it with the employee directory info. I trace down the employee who use the above computer and IP address informations, I found out that the employee name is Robert Taylor Jr. This employee is a contract worker and his service in the organzation has already ended since 2019 (4 years ago) but he was not remove from the organization system. this gave him the privilege to access the organization system and did the fund transfer

This incident could have been be prevent if the employee has been removed since the end of his service at the organization and least privilege policy was implemented.

### Achievement

- understand the importance of least privilege and multi-factor authentication

- investigated the incident using the provided event log info compare to the employee directory information

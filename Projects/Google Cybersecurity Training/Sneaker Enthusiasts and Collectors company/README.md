## Scenario

Youâ€™re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

### The objective

- 2-3 business objectives

- 2-3 technology requirements

- 2 potential threats

- 2 system vulnerabilities

- 4 defenses that limit risk

## My approach

The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. A threat model of the application is prepared using PASTA framework. 

- Stage 1: Define business and security objectives

      The organisation want to create an E-commerce app to connect sellers to buyers. The app will handle both customer PII and SPII.

- Stage 2: Define the technical scope

      The app will be develop using API, PKI, SHA-256 and SQL technology.

- Stage 3: Decompose application

      An data flow diagram is drawn.

- Stage 4: Threat analysis

      The risk involved in hanlding customer PII and SPII are SQL injection and Session hijacking.

- Stage 5: Vulnerability analysis

      The app is vulnerable to Lack of validation on user input, Fail-open error handling, Not closing the database connection properly, Broken AP token.

- Stage 6: Attack modeling

      An attack tree diagram was drawn.

- Stage 7: Risk analysis and impact

      In keeping the app safe and proper handling of customer PII ans SPII, SHA-256, incident response procedures, password policy, principle of least privilege, should be put in place.

### Achievement

- Apply the seven stage of PASTA framework
- draft what the app will handle, the risk, threat and vulnerable involved and how to mitigate the risk.

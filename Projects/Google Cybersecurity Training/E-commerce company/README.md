## Scenario

You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

A vulnerability assessment of the situation can help you communicate the potential risks with decision makers at the company. You must create a written report that clearly explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

### The objective

- 3-5 sentences describing the reasons for conducting the security analysis in the Purpose section

- A completed Risk Assessment section

- 3-5 sentences explaining your reasoning for the identified risks in the Approach section

## My approach

The system description details what type of database server we use, the feature and capacity. The scope details the period of assessment and guildlines followed during the assessment. The purpose of the database server is serve as a storage for customer information and business product documentation.

The risk of keeping the database server public place the company on higher risk, employee can obtain sensitive information, competitor can perform reconnaissance on the organization and hackers can delete the entire information or encrypted for ramsome.

My recommendition for the organization is to 
- set the database server to private
- installed firewalls to prevent intruder
- employee should be given least privilege

### Achievement

- Documented risk assessment report
- Evaluted risk assessment and the impact it can caused
- recommendation to prevent risk

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. There’s no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used for this very purpose because it’s one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The  software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn’t connected to other files or networks, so the USB drive can’t affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.

### The objective

- 2-3 sentences about the types of information stored on the USB drive

- 2-3 sentences about how the information could be used against the owner and/or organization

- 3-4 sentences analyzing the risks of USB baiting attacks

## My approach

After I explored the content of the USB flash, I discovered it belong to Jorge. It contains jorge personal files and work related files. Having work related file and personal file on same storage devices is non practical idea, both file should be separate.

I provided some security caution and awareness to prevent further risk, If other employee found the USB flash and explore it on the computer while the USB flash is been infected by hacker can infect the organization network. If by chance, an hacker found the USB flash which belong to Jorge is a vulnerability to Jorge and the Hospital.

### Achievement

- Suggested attacker mindset if the USB flash was found by hacker.
- Ananlyzied the risk involve for keeping personal file and office file together, exploring unknown USB flash, risk of enablen auto run while exploring any type of USB flash.
- Defends line to prevent the risk such as setting up an antivirus software.

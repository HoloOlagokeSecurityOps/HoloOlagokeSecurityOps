## Scenario

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

- Desktop or laptop computers

- Smartphones

- Smart home devices

- Game consoles

- Storage devices or servers

- Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

### The objective

- List of 3 devices on the home network

- List network access, owner, and location for each device

- 1–2 notes on network access

- A sensitivity classification

## My approach

I classified each asset to their sensitive and access to network. My Network router, Servers and Desktop computer will continuely has access to the network and are highly sensitive for this reason they are kept confidentially and restricted.

Other assests like Guest smartphone, Video streaming devices and Game console are occasional has access to my network are classified as internal-only sensitivity assest.

### Achievement

- Classified assests base on their network accessibility, ownership, location and sensitivity

- Understand the importance of classifying assest accoring to sensitivity

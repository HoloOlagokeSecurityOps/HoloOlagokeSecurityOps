## Overview

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

- The organization’s employees' share passwords.

- The admin password for the database is set to the default.

- The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

- Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

### The challenge

- OMention 0ne to three network hardening tools and methods.

- State the reasons why the tools and methods selected are effective.

## My process

After the organization experienced  a data breach, which put customer's personal information at risk, the organization want to know the cause for the breach. I investigated the incident and discover four major vulnerabilities; Password are shared among employee, Admin password for database is set as default, a single login grant access no muitifactor authentication, no firewall setting to filter incoming and outgoing traffic

Security harden option are list to strenghten the security posture such as

- password policy - the option to use at least 8 characters long and mix character such as alpha-numeric and symbol

- multifactor authentication - just in  case username and passwpord are compromised, this will also add extra security layer during login

- data encryption using lastest standard - data encrption helps incase database is compromised etc.

### Achievement

- Document attack incidents and analyze weak security areas and how to improve security posture and mitigate risk.

- Implemented new method of configuring Firewall to harden network security by filter abnormal traffic in company internal network.

- Explaied network harden and how it strenghten organization inter network.
